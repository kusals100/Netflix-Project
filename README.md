 # Simple Movie Recommendation System

This is a simple command-line prototype for a movie recommendation system, created for the ICT 2233 Data Structures and Algorithms assignment.

## Description

The program suggests movies to a user based on the ratings of another user with similar tastes. This is a basic implementation of **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**.

The main data structure used is a **Dictionary (acting as a Hash Table)** to store and quickly access user ratings and movie titles. The algorithm also uses **Sets** for efficient comparison
